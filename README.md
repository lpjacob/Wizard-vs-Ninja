# Wizard-vs-Ninja
GCSE CS - model solution to problem

The game: Player 1 takes the wizard character and is prompted to enter the modifier values for each attribute (speed, strength, magic etc) from the table below. For each attribute, the program with roll 2 six-sided dice and add the total to the attribute modifier. Player 2 then takes the ninja character and repeats the process with their values.

Player 1 can then choose which attribute to play first (e.g. Speed). The value for both players is compared and the higher value wins, earning the winner 1 point. The winner can then pick which attributes to play next. If both players have the same score it is a draw and both get 0 points and another attribute is chosen. 

The first player to score 3 points is declared the winner and the game ends. If there is no winner once all attributes have been played, there is option to play again without re-rolling the attribute scores.

At the end of the game a score table is written to a text file showing the values compared in  each round and which player won each round.
